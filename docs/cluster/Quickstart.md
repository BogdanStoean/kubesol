# Kubesol quickstart

A full production Kubesol setup will require at least 7 VMs (one gateway, 3 controller nodes, 3 worker nodes). But you may experiment on a single VM even with some limitations.

For this, create a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu Linux and at least 8GB RAM, 2-8 CPU cores, 50 GB disk.

TBD
